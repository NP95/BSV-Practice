Discussion question 1) Missing answers to some of the questions
Discussion question 2) Your pipeline stages are not all firing in the same cycle 
because your scoreboard is not large enough to have an instruction executing in 
RegisterFetch, Execute, Memory, and Write Back all at the same time. Try 
increasing the size of your scoreboard so you get about 102 cycles for the 
baseline assembly test.
Bonus: It looks like you redirect JR properly, but you introduced some new
conflicts between rules.
