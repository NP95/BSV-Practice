For discussion question 2, the formula for branch predictor accuracy is
2 - 1/IPC, you can see that because the number of cycles for this
processor to execute a program is
  Cycles = Instructions + (1 - Accuracy) * Instructions

In response to the bonus discussion questions: As you learned from later
lectures, branch prediction is a bit more complicated than just having a
large enough btb, direction prediction is important two.
