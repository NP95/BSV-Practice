Discussion Question 1 (10 Points): In the spirit of the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday, list some reasons you are thankful you only have to do this lab on a one cycle processor. To get you started: what new hazards would exceptions introduce if you were working on a pipelined implementation?

1. Exceptions can be caused from different stages and/or different instructions in the pipeline
2. Keep track of earliest instruction or stage exception
3. We would need to redirect PC at the commit stage for exceptions, which requires more epochs
4. More modifications -> more debugging
